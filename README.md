## Overview
Cub3D is a 3D game developed with raycasting techniques. The project is inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D game.

Our goal is to give a similar experience with custome textures, level and so much more...

## Key Features
- **Raycasting Engine:** Implements a raycasting engine to render 3D graphics from a 2D map.
- **Custom Textures:** Supports custom textures for walls, objects, and sprites.
- **Multiple Level:** For the bonus part we include multiple levels with different layout and challenges.
